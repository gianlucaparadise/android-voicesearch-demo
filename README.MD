# VoiceSearchDemo

This app is a basic implementation of the Google assistant Voice Search feature to test its capabilities.

**N.B.** The App needs to be published into the Play Store to let Google Assistant open the app using voice. During the development phase you can test using the following script:

```sh
sh send-search.sh "querytext"
```
